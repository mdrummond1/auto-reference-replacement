# auto-reference-replacement
This project is something that I've been thinking of for a while
The idea is that when taking notes you will insert a placeholder reference into your document (right now assumed to be  text file for simplicity).
At some point you can run this document through the program, and it will insert the referenced material at the placeholder.

I originally though of this in reference to taking sermon notes. So you can put in a verse reference, ie "Genesis 1:1", 
and run the program. Genesis 1:1 will be appended with "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
